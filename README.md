- **Error Handling**: Invalid files or missing sheets are handled gracefully

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**File Not Loading**
- Ensure file is in .xlsx or .xls format
- Check file isn't corrupted
- Try with a smaller file first

**No Results in Column G**
- Verify lookup values exist in reference file Column A
- Check for exact matches (case-sensitive)
- Ensure reference file has data in Column B

**Sheet Not Found**
- Make sure your main file contains the selected sheet name
- Sheet names are case-sensitive

**Processing Fails**
- Check last row number is valid
- Ensure both files are uploaded correctly
- Try refreshing the page and re-uploading

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **File Naming**: Use descriptive names for easy identification
2. **Data Cleanup**: Remove extra spaces or formatting from lookup columns
3. **Backup**: Always keep original files as backup
4. **Testing**: Try with a small dataset first
5. **Validation**: Check a few results manually after processing
